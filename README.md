**Assessing the Effectiveness of MGNREGA in Rural Development: A Case of Andhra Pradesh**


## Abstract
This study evaluates the performance of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) in Andhra Pradesh for the period 2018–2024, covering both pre-COVID (2018–2020) and post-COVID (2022–2024) phases.  
The analysis focuses on fund utilization, employment generation, women participation, social inclusion, asset creation and district-level efficiency using a Composite Performance Index (CPI).
The work highlights major inter-district disparities and identifies persistent structural bottlenecks in fund utilization. The study further proposes the use of predictive analytics and machine learning based approaches to improve fund flow efficiency and governance.

## Data Sources
- MGNREGA official portal – Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India  
- Government of Andhra Pradesh district-level reports

## Methodology
- Phase-wise analysis based on administrative structure:
  - 13 districts (2018–2020)
  - 26 districts (2022–2024)
- Data preprocessing and visualization using Python (Google Colab)
- Summary analysis using Microsoft Excel
- Performance evaluation using a Composite Performance Index (CPI) derived from:
  - fund management
  - employment generation
  - social inclusion
  - asset creation

## Key Highlights
- Women participation consistently exceeds 57% at the state level.
- Fund utilization remains critically low across both phases.
- District-level efficiency varies significantly.
- Vizianagaram and Visakhapatnam emerge as top performing districts in the post-COVID phase.
- The study proposes predictive fund-flow and governance models using machine learning for future policy improvement.
